# Quantum Game is hiring: JavaScript developer

We are looking for a JavaScript developer for the [Quantum Game](https://quantumgame.io) - an in-browser science based game, and an educational platform. You will work in a remote team of about 7 people with various backgrounds (physics, design, science communication, arts, and programming), for a 2+ year project (we got NCBR grant GameINN and start this September).

Compensation depends on your skill and experience, from the range 22 000 - 13 000 PLN/month on a job contract (“umowa o pracę”). It’s 16 412 - 9 777 PLN/month after taxes (for people living in Poland). Depending on the skill your job title will be Lead GameDev or FrontEnd Developer.

Your first tasks will involve adopting the current state of Quantum Game so it works on mobile devices, writing end-to-end tests, adding game options (e.g. volume) and making level sharing smoother.

Core requirements:

* Proficiency with JavaScript environment
* Experience with Vue.js or React.js (including reactive sites)
* Fluent software engineering skills (including good patterns, git, tests)
* Ability to work remotely (communication, realistic time estimates) 

We don’t expect you to know quantum mechanics :). At the same time, we do expect experience with interactive media (GameDev, data visualization, dashboards). 

Current tech stack is TypeScript + Vue.js + SVG + jest + yarn + Firebase. It will evolve with the project, depending on the gameplay, artistic vision and your expertise. If it turns out that it is more efficient to use WebGL, we will do so. (Expect for TypeScript; [we love TypeScript](https://p.migdal.pl/2020/03/02/types-tests-typescript.html) and it stays.).

Bonus points for:

* Experience with GameDev or creating [Explorable Explanations](https://explorabl.es/)
* Experience in numerics (from engineering, biology, physics, anything) 
* Interest in popular science, science communication or education
* Open source projects (on GitHub or other)
* Experience with WASM (e.g. using Rust)

Perks:

* You will take part in making a cool game, and changing education
* All code is open-source (<https://github.com/Quantum-Game/>)
* We speak communicative JavaScript (yes, yes - including UX/UI and sound artist)
* You will get a strong machine of your choice

If you are interested, send an email to pmigdal+qgjs@gmail.com. Don’t forget to include:

* Your current Resume
* If you do have, links to your GitHub and LinkedIn profiles
* What did you find the most fascinating in this project?
* Yout time-space availability

We believe that creativity needs honesty, openness, and kindness. We are open to adjustments for your needs (e.g. education, parenting, health, lifestyle etc). We do our best to make this project inclusive. Our default communication tool is Basecamp and we do like synchronous communication.
